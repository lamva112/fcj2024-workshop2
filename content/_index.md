# Deploying Spring Boot Services on AWS ECS Fargate using AWS CDK

#### Overview

In this workshop, we will create a microservice using Java 11, leveraging the Spring Boot framework, and Docker containers to build a backend application that interacts with Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. These resources will be provisioned on AWS using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) v2, a modern way to model and configure infrastructure on AWS. AWS CDK is one of the best tools for managing infrastructure as code (IaC) on AWS.
